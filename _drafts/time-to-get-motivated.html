<p>I started this blog in October of 2013, and as of writing this post today, there is not yet one post on it; not one Facebook update, comment, or inkling of activity, save the rare bot landing me a meager page view. To be frank it's because of motivation - something which is blatantly necessary to start a blog, yet something which I painfully lack. I am not alone, however, I am not even the minority; in fact I am the majority. To think how many other blogs out there are not even thought of by their owners. So, not unlike other people, I delayed updating my blog, thinking positively about the days yet to come as a flourishing and important blogger; sipping my pretentious tea, feeling as optimistic as an aspiring blogger can be.</p>
<p>But it's time to get to the point. That's what blogging is all about, is it not? What I'm trying to do, is to create a message to any other "aspiring" blogger, any lazy gamer, or person of great imagination yet little <em>doing</em>. If you have, for some reason, chanced upon this article, I thank you, weary traveler, for taking the time to  click on such an obscure and next to invisible blog. In all reality, however, It is time to stop researching, stop day-dreaming, it is time to jump in, and start <em>doing</em>. Whatever your goal is - whether to create the next <em>Mashable, </em><em>Cnet, </em><em>Facebook,  </em>become the next NaNiwa, Idra, or Day[9], you must <em>do</em>. As Henry Thoreau famously stated [blockquote source="Henry D. Thoreau"]“You cannot dream yourself into a character: you must hammer and forge yourself into one.”[/blockquote]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsndrKhLPlU" target="_blank">In an interview with Peter Cashmore - creator of </a><em>Mashable, </em>he mentions that he started "with knowing nothing", yet he now owns the most popular blog on the internet. In his early days, he used his parents computer, and did as much as he could to meet his goals. In other words, he hammered himself into character.</p>
<p>Nothing progressive will come of dreaming; especially not for something like a blog. Aspiring bloggers will never become Bloggers if all they do is aspire; it does not matter their skill level, ability, profession; to start a successful blog, one must begin to <em>do</em>, and through this, it will not matter if whatever they do fail or succeeds, what matters is that one learns from experience, and continues to trudge on.</p>
<p>You may be asking at this point; "Why listen to this person? He is no more successful at blogging then I!". And to that I say - this is truth; this post may be more for my use than yours. I created this post to <em>do</em> something, and through this, I hope to help others - which I will do throughout the life of this blog; I hope to create more posts like this one, charting my progress as a blogger, in effect helping others through my experience. If you are interested, subscribe to <a href="http://www.liquidthink.net/category/liquid-thoughts/feed">this feed</a> for updates and more posts like this one. Today I had no posts, yet this afternoon I will have <strong>one</strong>. Today, I am updating this blog, for my dear Google Crawler bot, to read through, and hopefully share to his ultimately more powerful big Brother, Google, that I am no longer the majority, today is the day LiquidThink.net is among the minority.</p>
