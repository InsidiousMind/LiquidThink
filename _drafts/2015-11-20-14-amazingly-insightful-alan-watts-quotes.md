9 Marvelously Profound Alan Watts Quotes, in Pictures
---
It was cold, but it did not bite. It was also Alan Watt's ideal day. The river ran wild in reprise whilst the sound of the sky churning made for a fusion of sound which engrossed the mind. Watts, an eclectic philosopher from the mid 60's would have enjoyed such a day. As someone who is best known for interpreting and popularizing eastern ideals for a western audience, he would have loved the atmosphere. If he were out, where I sit, right this instant, he may have said in reference to nature that "it all wiggles'. "Everything in nature is wiggly".
As a speaker he greatly advocated for nature and the universe, whilst protesting contradictory social constructs.

Alan Watts once said:
>For some reason or other we find wiggly things very difficult to keep track of. And we say to people, 'keep still' 'stay still for the camera'. And we say 'well lets get things straightened out'. 'Lets get this squared away'. And somehow we think we understand things when we have translated them in terms of straight lines and squares. Maybe that's why they call rather rigid people squares. But it doesn't fit nature. You know wherever human beings have been around and done their thing, we find rectangles. We live in boxes. Streets are laid out in a grid pattern. They've even dropped a grid pattern on San-Francisco, so that cars can run away. Because it seems human beings have a rather simple mind, and all this wiggliness is too complicated.

Other than his interesting sense of humor, Watts always made a large emphasis of the difference between human thinking and things of nature, which just *are*.

>Things become complicated when we have to think about it. That's because we are trying to translate them into a form of life that is very much simpler and cruder than the forms of life we are talking about. a triangle is much cruder than a mountain, even though you may represent a mountain with a triangle. Human beings are just as wiggly as nature, and our brains are an incredible mess of wiggles. and we understand that the least.

Maybe you can see, now, that Alan Watts definitely had an interesting perspective of life. As Alan Watts would say, I invite you to look at things through a different perspective.


>You are something the whole universe is doing, in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing. The *real* you **is** the whole universe

Watts was 

Try to imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up... now try to imagine what it was like to wake up having never gone to sleep.

if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you'll be spending your life completely wasting you're time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing, in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things which you don't like doing. Which is stupid...better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing, then a long life spent in a miserable way.

If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death, or shall i say, death implies life, you can *feel* yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as something on probation, not as something that has arrived hereby fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. 

Don't make a distinction between work and play. Regard everything that you're doing as play, and don't regard for one minute that you have to be serious about it.
CONTEXT:
Imagine if you're a bus driver. Ordinarily considered a harrased person. Has to watch out for people, cops, cars. If this is work, it will be hell. Suppose he has this idea where moving the truck through traffic is this very subtle game. He has this feeling about it like playing guitar. So he makes a music of the thing. Well he won't be tired out at the end of the day. He will be full of energy when he's done with his job. Don't make a distinction between work and play. Regard everything that you're doing as play, and don't regard for one minute that you have to be serious about it.
In our culture, we make an extremely rigid division between work and play. You're supposed to work in order to earn enough money to give you sufficient leisure time, for something entirely different called having fun-or play.

The only Zen you’ll find on mountain tops is the Zen you bring up there with you.

Philosophy is man’s expression of curiosity about everything and his attempt to make sense of the world primarily through his intellect.

Who said you're supposed to survive?
Who gave you the idea that it's agast to go on and on and on
we can't say it's a good thing for everything to go on living, for the simple reason that we would overcrowd ourselves
In a way, when someon dies it's honorable because he is making room for others
If our death could be indefinitely postponed, we would not actually go on postponing it indefinitely. Because after a certain point we would realize that that isn't a way in which we would want it to survive. Why would we have children? Because children enables us to survive in another way. Because, as it were, passing on a torch so you don't have to carry it all the time. and say "now you work".
It's a far more amusing arangement for nature. To continue the process of life through different individuals than it is for the same individual. Because as each new individual approaches life, life is renewed. And one remembers, how fascinating the most ordinary everyday things are to a child. Because they see them all as marvelous. Because they seem them all in a way that is unrelated to survival and profit. When we get to thinking of everything in terms of survival and profit value, then the shapes of scratches on the floor cease to have magic. And most things, in fact, cease to have magic. So therefore, in the course of nature, once we have ceased to see magic in the world anymore, we are no longer fullfilling natures game of being aware of itself. There's no point in it anymore, so we die. And so something else comes to birth, which has a new view. It is therefore unnatural to us to prolong life indefinitely. but we live in a culture that it has been rubbed into us that to die is a terrible thing.

Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the Gods made for fun.
