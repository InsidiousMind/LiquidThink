There are so many software development companies out there, and you probably want yours to be one of the best. You can’t expect that to happen unless you have something to back you up, however. Getting your voice heard and your brand recognised is very important. It’s not something that is easy to do. Here are some ways to get people to take your small software development company seriously.

## Become an Industry Leader

Many of the most successful software and [tech](http://liquidthink.net/4-ways-technology-is-changing-art-and-design "tech") companies have a recognisable figurehead. So, try to become an industry leader. When you can get your face recognised, people will start to take you and your startup a little more seriously. You could speak at big events or become a better leader in your office. Both of these things are important. But don’t simply hide behind your brand. People often want to see a human face, and that face has got to be yours if you own the company. Putting yourself forward could really help the [brand](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/276520 "brand") a lot, so give it a try.

## Run an Informative Blog

Businesses don’t have to be 100% functional. There are lots of other things your business could do to get recognised other than making money. For example, you could start a [blog](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/blogging-tips-from-the-pros/) that is linked to the company. That way, anyone who arrives at your website could read some related content that they might be interested in. The good thing about this is that it adds another dimension to your brand and shows everyone that you know what you are talking about. That is a pretty big deal, and it shouldn’t be taken lightly, so make sure that you make the blog informative.

## Create Software That Can be Trusted

When your business creates software, it needs to be trusted. If it’s not, then people will take a look at it and then turn away. So, create software carefully and steadily. And make sure that it is always properly tested before it gets to be released. If you do this, over the years your business will develop a positive reputation that will only help it in terms of sales. But that’s the long-term. Right now, you need to be thinking about the short-term and what it could mean for your business. This article on the [100+ Best Software Testing Tools](https://www.qasymphony.com/blog/100-plus-best-software-testing-tools/) can help you to perfect the testing process.

## Try to Get to Know Influencers

In pretty much every industry there are [influencers](http://labs.openviewpartners.com/networking-tips-from-top-influencers/) that have their say and have a voice. These are people that get listened to. When they say something positive about a company or a product, it carries weight. So, you should do what you can do get an endorsement from one of these companies if you can. It could really help your business to get to where you want it to. Get to know them, network at events where you might meet them organically. And let them know about your business, what it’s doing and why they should care about it. If you can do that, it will benefit your business.
