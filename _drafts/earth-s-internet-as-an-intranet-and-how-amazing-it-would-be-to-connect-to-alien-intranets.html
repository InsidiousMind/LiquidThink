<p>The year is 2142. alternisInsidious just came back from a tedious time at his midterm exams, puts on his virtual reality glasses and decides he wants a chat with his online friends, most exited to see what his friend from region 3421_8B MARS is up to, martians do, as it turns out, have quite the fascinating lifestyle. alternisInsidious' friend tells him all the rave about a new Martian drug, so, gathering all his essential anonymous decentralized gear he logs into the underbelly of the Martian darknet and checks out martian-Shrooms. They're just like shrooms from Earth, but they have been genetically modified to survive and grow in a synthetic Martian ecosphere.</p>
