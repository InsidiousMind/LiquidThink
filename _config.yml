    I’m a born tech nerd. Well…probably not born, but I’m working on it. I fanaticize everything programming, hacking, or Lovecraft (probably a bit too much for my own good). This blog is about all theoretical nerdy-geeky stuff  to do with technology. If you’re more into technical nerdy stuff, check out The Cyber Cult my other blog!
