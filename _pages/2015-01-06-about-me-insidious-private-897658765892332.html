Here, I write articles and make videos on anything from Gadgets and Programming to Science Fiction and Video Games. I hope to connect and share my ideas with other people, bloggers and communities--ultimately creating a more connected, informed and innovative internet space.</p>
<p>In addition to writing, I create and design websites. In the past, I have designed a website for <a href="http://liquidthink.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/www.partyfairchester.com">The Party Fair</a>, as well as my own website, right here at Liquid Think. If you are interested in my Web Design services, my contact information is below.</p>
<p>If you are a writer/Vlogger or another blogger looking for a guest opportunity, contact us! We are always open to new perspectives on different subjects/ideas, and would love to work with you.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Little About me:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Currently a Senior in High School, in the future, I hope to major in Computer Science and English at a reputable University. Currently my favorite authors are George Orwell, Isaac Asimov, C.S Lewis, JRR Tolkien H.P Lovecraft, and Stephen King. I listen mostly to alternative/indie music, butÂ enjoy the occasional Dance/Electronic tune. During my summers I adore sailing in my Laser Dinghy, or just relaxing and reading a good book.</p>
