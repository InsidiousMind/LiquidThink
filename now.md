I'm at University, I spend all my time on these things, in the order of the time I spend on them:

* Studying at The University of Scranton

* Writing at This Blog

* Writing at The Cyber Cult

* Web Design for Clients

* Reading books to better think, live, and write

* Going through wargames @ overthewire.org

* Building a Purely Personal profile page

* Slowly learning Japanese in preparation for studying abroad in the fall of 2016

That's it. This is where I put all my time. If you want to suggest I do something else, however, I'm open to new suggestions.
