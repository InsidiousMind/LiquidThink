I'm at University, I spend all my time on these things, in the order of the time I spend on them:

* Studying at The University of Scranton

* Writing at This Blog

* Reading books to better think, live, and write
  - currently reading *Understanding Power* By Noam Chomsky

* Going through Challenges on hackerrank.com
*
* Building a Purely Personal profile page

That's it. This is where I put all my time. If you want to suggest I do something else, however, I'm open to new suggestions.
