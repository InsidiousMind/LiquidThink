## My Beautiful Website.

This is a website which has been (and is currently in the process) of being moved to Wordpress. And this is the sourcecode.

The site itself is at [Liquid Think](http://www.liquidthink.net). There, I post on subjects like technology, mindfulness, high existence, and other such topics.

A Little about me...
I am interested in everything programming, hacking, or Lovecraft (probably a bit too much for my own good). This blog is about all theoretical nerdy-geeky stuff to do with technology. If you’re more into technical nerdy stuff, check out The Cyber Cult my other blog! 
If you want to know more, you can head over to my [About Page](http://www.liquidthink.net/about).

If you're interested in what I am doing *now* head over to my [Now Page](http://www.liquidthink.net/now)
