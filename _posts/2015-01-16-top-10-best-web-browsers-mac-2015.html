<p><strong>4.    Apple Safari</strong></p>
<p>This comes pre-installed on all Apple products capable of supporting web-surfing being Apple’s official browser. It has RSS integration and a speed dial and bookmark to allow easy access to most viewed web pages. It has a very innovative interface and most MAC users like because of its high speeds. However, when used on non-Apple products, some of its features may not work as efficiently as when used on Apple products.</p>

<p><strong>5.    Maxthon</strong></p>
<p>Most Mac users who use this browser love it for the features which enable easy sharing of documents and files between different devices. Operating with less speed and with a less-than-stellar interface, however, it is nowhere near the leading browsers stated in this list.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>6.    OmniWeb Browser</strong></p>
<p>The OmniWeb Browser allows Mac users to visit all web pages without any worry of compatibility issues. It has thumbnails that allow easy storage of most visited web pages, and interesting plug-ins to make browsing interesting. Limited with startup and navigation speeds, however, it is quite slow when compared to other mainstreams browsers.</p>
