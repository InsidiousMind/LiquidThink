I started meditating a few months back, out of pure interest and curiosity. Since then my mind continues to surprise.

**The peace I find intrigues me every time I sit down for a session.**

When I began researching meditation, I rolled my eyes at the claims some made. "It will open your heart", "You will feel more compassionate". You know that weird, icky feeling you get when your Dad comes up with another one of his Dad-jokes? Or when your girlfriend says something super cheesy? Well, that's the best way to describe the feeling I got.

I would think to myself:  "how could sitting down for a few minutes at a time grant these kinds of effects?". Well, there was only one way to find out, meditate.

Since then, I have engaged in secular meditation at least three-times a week for the last few months. I can't say I have 'opened my heart'. Maybe it takes longer for that; I am by no means a 'zen master'. Even so, changes did take place, and they are definitively positive.

For me, meditation is a path into peace, stress relief, heightened problem solving (what some call 'Divergent Thinking'), and emotional intelligence. Scientific studies are on my side, [Psychology Today][1b8bfc8e] lists 20 scientific reasons (and links to the corresponding studies) to start meditating, with more and more scientific studies coming out everyday.

One [paper][645e0b1d] found that:
>With regards to identity state meditative experience was found to produce statistically significant changes in terms of intensity in meaning (P < 0.05), time sense (P < 0.05), joy (P < 0.05), love (P < 0.05) and state of awareness (P < 0.01).

These results show that meditation invokes an altered state of consciousness. One similar yet distinctly different than those invoked by psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide and Psilocybin.

A cute video which struck the note right on it's head for me on describing secular meditation, is right here:

Now, onto the ten tips:

## Take it in Stages
Don't just sit down and expect to be able to meditate to the fullest degree. Create a routine for yourself. For Example, you can take a queue from my beginners routine:

{% include image.html img="uploads/2015/12/2/Meditation_by_Victor_Tongdee.jpg" title="Meditation by Victor Tongdee" url="uploads/2015/12/2/Meditation_by_Victor_Tongdee" class="alignright" align="right" height="500" width="300"%}

- Sit down and get yourself comfortable. This can be on the floor, bed, chair, wherever. Fidgeting to remain comfortable throughout is fine.
- Start with your eyes open, but with a 'soft' gaze. Don't concentrate on anything in particular, or move your head to look at something. Just your eyes open.
- Take a few long deep breaths. They should be loud enough, that if someone were sitting next to you they would be able to hear your breathing.
- Close your eyes on your last deep breath.
- Sit for a few seconds, and start a body scan. Begin with the focus on your head, then move down your body relaxing each part one by one.
- Start counting your breaths. Don't try to regulate your breath. Just let it come with the usual and natural rhythm of your body. Rinse and repeat. Once you're comfortable with this, an inhale/exhale cycle becomes one.
- Continue that for as long as you want. When your about ready to finish, just let go of any sort of focus. Let your mind wander if it wants, just let it do whatever.
- Bring the mind back, opening your eyes whenever you are ready.
- Think about how you feel and your experience meditating once your eyes are open. Notice how you feel.

## Put on some Music
Whenever I meditate, I use a [Meditation Music][c30f2a96] application. It sets the mood, and I kind of enter my own little peaceful world. I live in a college dorm, therefore students screaming over a Mario cart game is commonplace.  Music definitely helps create a more peaceful atmosphere.

## Use Guided Meditation
Guided meditation is a great way for beginners to start learning how to meditate. I used [Headspace][d1c3a6f8], which provides a large series of guided meditations to bring you from beginner to master. If you want to become my buddy in the app, you can email me: insidious@liquidthink.net. I always welcome new friends!
Also, [Alan Watts][82a2b1bd] has a great series of guided meditations. Many of them are available on youtube, or other such sites.

Here's one I like:

## Decide on a Time
Decide on the time you want to meditate beforehand. If your end goal is to meditate for a specified amount of time,  approach the goal in steps. Set your time at first to 10 minutes, then increase by 5 minutes every week or whenever you feel comfortable. Strive to reach that goal, and you will.

## Stretch
Stretching? Why would I want to stretch before meditating? That's what I thought when I first started. In reality, if you're only meditating for 10 minutes at a time you do not need to stretch. If you plan on meditating for longer,  this would help the body sit still for extended periods of time.

## Choose a Nice Atmosphere

Environment is key. For example, whenever I write I try to create the most perfect environment I can. I get myself to a coffee shop, put on some chill music, sit down in my favorite comfy chair. Or, I will go out to the park and bring my notepad, setting myself down near the rushing sound of the water. That is when I write at my best.

Meditation is the same. Put yourself in the most perfect environment you can so that you *want* to meditate. Go outside under the droopy willow tree, or to the park. Try to choose a place that is silent and peaceful, and it will be much easier to meditate.

Yet,  to effectively meditate you do not have to find a silent place. Though I do prefer a silent place, I oft meditate in my dormitory which gets loud at times. Still, I feel no loss of effectiveness meditating in either environment.

## Attend a Group Guided Meditation
At my University, they have a week where a Buddhist monk comes to meditate with the students. It's a great de-stressor, and introduces many students to the practice of meditation. Never mind that, when was the last time you got to meditate with a Buddhist monk?!

Look for events around where you live. The website [Meditation Meet-up][e08e8216] makes it easy to find others who meditate, or just ask around and look at your town bulletin board.

## Try Mantra Meditation
Personally I have not done this one, but some people I spoke to said it helped. Interestingly, psychological research seems to agree. Evidence states that repeating a mantra associates your meditative state to the mantra. This helps engage the body in a deeper level of consciousness faster.

A good mantra to start off with is 'one', 'peace', or 'calm'. Throughout the meditation session, repeat the mantra to yourself. If your mind wanders off, don't worry about it and just refocus. Some stop repeating the mantra once they have reached a certain level of consciousness. Do whatever works best for you.

## Get the Posture Right
Good posture will mean it is easier to breathe, since it gives your lungs more room to expand. The right posture will also be the most comfortable position. It should almost feel like you are 'floating'. Besides, good posture during meditation encourages better posture throughout your day.

## De-stress before you Meditate
Sometimes,  you are just too anxious, nervous,  or generally too stressed to meditate. Don't panic, it happens. Do something beforehand to de-stress yourself enough for meditation. Go for a walk, a run, or take a shower.

Remember, meditation is a journey. Continue to do it, and you will reap the benefits as well as discover more about yourself and your mind. There's some interesting stuff up there, it's just waiting to be dug up by you.
