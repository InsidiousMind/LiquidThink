<p>The concept of time travel is something that's intrigued scientists, astronomers, philosophers, and cultures from across the world for centuries. From H.G. Wells' classic novel <em>The Time Machine</em> to modern-day shows like <em>Dr. Who</em>,<br />
it's human nature to dream of traveling in time. While some people may disregard it as science fiction, there are actually two sound theories for traveling in time. 2 Ways To Theoretically Travel In Time</p>

<h2>Method #1) Velocity Time Travel</h2>

<p>The first method we're going to discuss is velocity time travel, which states that a person's internal clock ticks slower when he or she travels at a faster speed. The theory of velocity-based time dilation was put to the test in October 1971,<br />
when physicist J. Haefele and astronomer R. Keating conducted an experiment using atomic clocks. The duo flew around the world twice with four highly accurate cesium atomic clocks aboard their plane. When they landed, they compared their clocks with<br />
those at the United States Navel Observatory. Haefele and Keating discovered the clocks on the airliner were slower than those at the Observatory, confirming that velocity affects time perception.</p>

<p>Assuming this theory is correct, it would have some pretty significant implications on interstellar travel. If mankind were to invest a spaceship that's capable of traveling near the speed of light, astronauts on board wouldn't return to the world<br />
they knew. The astronauts may have spent just one year traveling in space, but decades would have passed on Earth.</p>

<br>

<h2>Method #2) Gravitational Time Travel</h2>
<p>The general consensus among most astrophysicists today is that gravity distorts time. This concept was first described in Einstein’s general theory of relativity, in which he suggests that clocks closer to gravitational fields tick slower than those away from gravitational fields. It's unknown how exactly this phenomenon occurs, but time slows (relatively speaking) as it approaches gravitational fields. For instance, time passes faster for a climber atop a snow-covered mountain than a person standing at the base of the mountain – to a <em>very</em> small degree, of course.</p>

<p>Astrophysicist Neil Tyson DeGrasse suggested that astronauts could travel in time by going around a black hole – just before the point of no return – in a spaceship. Because black holes have such an enormous gravitational field, time would pass significantly slower for anyone or anything near.</p>
<p>It's important to note that both of the theories mentioned above only involve forward/future time travel, meaning you can't go back in time. Yes, traveling into the future is possible by either traveling fast or nearing yourself to a strong gravitational<br />
field. Regardless of which method is used, however, you won't be able to travel into the past. This is probably a good thing anyway, as time travel into past would open up a whole new world of paradoxical problems.</p>
