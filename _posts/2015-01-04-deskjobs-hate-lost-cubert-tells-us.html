<p>In November, SadPenPusher Motion Pictures released their "Lost Cubert" Sketch. Claiming many awards at short-film festivals around the world, this Kafka-esque animation shows us all why we hate desk jobs.  They are repetitive, boring, constricting and generally not fun to work in. Lost Cubert takes this to it's own level. I explain my thoughts further, but for now here is the beautifully animated short:</p>

<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/115189988" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/115189988">Lost Cubert</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/lostcubert">Lost Cubert</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not running a blog for nothing! As a 17-year-old; I really hope to avoid the boring desk life. I'm not totally sure where life will take me after college; but one place I will avoid with a vengeance are desk-jobs. Hell, I'll keep updating this thing from under a bridge to avoid <em>that</em>. (this is assuming I don't find work as a programmer at somewhere more exciting than a deskjob, like at a start-up or something ;).</p>
<p>Enough about my own life, though, what about our Dear protagonist, Cubert?</p>
<p>From the start, our protagonist finds himself at a desk job. He already looks unhappy--typing away at his typewriter, sluggishly moving around, printing out documents, etc. The animation reflects this too--bland animation colors, full of shades of brown, create a dull, unhappy vibe to the video. The blending of 2D and 3D help exemplify the obscurity of the situation: People are made to sit out long hours in front of their tools, spitting out work which may or may not be quality according to how much effort they were able to put into a project after hours of straight work. Pointing to flaws in the commercial system we live in, where people are made to work to benefit higher-ups while they themselves receive a salary whilst their actual work may net the corporation much more than what they make themselves.</p>
<p>Then Cubert finds himself lost. Everywhere he goes he finds himself in an inexplicably similar place to the last, full of people exactly like him, so absorbed in their desk job that they cannot even notice him. It is almost as if they are all losing time from their life, to work at a boring desk job. They became so absorbed and taken in by it they cannot notice anything else. Cubert, however, has been temporarily relieved of the pressure of his job; yet he finds himself lost. He no longer has his desk job anchoring himself to his desk-job world; he no longer understands what to do.</p>
<p>Then, Cubert enters the room of white life. In it, he finds a cube; turning and spinning. We find that each individual cube represents an office/cubicle with their respective person working in it. This cube represents the Corporate Machine; eternally spinning and pumping out work from individuals to benefit some goal of the company. Cubert is unsure of what it is. Naturally, he touches it. Instantly he is transported back to his desk job, and Cubert is no longer lost; but again part of the machine of the cube, and so we have come full loop.</p>
<p>Those are my thoughts on the video. What did you think? Is Cubert still lost at the end, is their any hope left for our dear Cubert and his eerily-similar co-workers?</p>
