<p>Is this a surprise? nope. Does it confirm some of the worst fears? Of course it does.</p>
<p>I mean, did anyone <em>really</em> not suspect, or even already know, that Verizon or Sprint worked with the NSA. The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) has recently provided evidence that it was not just AT&amp;T who helped spy on millions of Americans, but also Verizon and Sprint.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="http://liquidthink.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nsa-cartoon-luckovich-495x365.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1833" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nsa-cartoon-luckovich-495x365.jpg" alt="nsa-cartoon-luckovich-495x365" width="495" height="365" /></a></p>
<p>From filings which the FISC (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) recently made public, the EFF was finally able to ascertain that Verizon and Sprint were also responsible in providing the National Security Agency with the phone records of millions of US Citizens.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this puts the focus back on the U.S Governments violations of the First and Fourth amendments, instead of delaying court cases dealing with spying on U.S Citizens.</p>
<p>The EFF is able to use this evidence in its case <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/smith-v-obama">Smith vs. Obama</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/first-unitarian-church-los-angeles-v-nsa">First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. NSA</a></p>
