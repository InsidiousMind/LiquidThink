<p>More often are we seeing the emergence of wearable technology hit the consumer market. Everything from watches to wearable tomatoe dispensers. It is fair to say that in the future wearable technology will become just another part of everyday life.</p>
<p>That's where <a href="http://www.sproutup.co/product/mycestro?refId=294393">Mycestro</a> comes in. The company claims with this small, inconspicuous device which attaches to your finger, one may 'Conduct your World'. Intrigued by Mycestro's ambition I decided to try the product out for myself.</p>
<h2>What's in the box?</h2>
<p>The Mycestro comes in a nifty little box with the logo on all sides. Inside, you can expect to find the device, a USB dongle, a micro-usb cable for /re, and the manual. The manual will conveniently lead you through the steps of using Mycestro, from charging to use.</p>

<h2>Design:</h2>
<p>Ideally, a mouse which is worn on the finger should be light and small enough that it does not impede typing yet is still able to perform all the functions of a traditional mouse. Fortunately, I found the <a href="http://www.sproutup.co/product/mycestro?refId=294393">Mycestro</a> to be a great weight. There was never a time that I felt it was too heavy or clunky that it impeded what I wanted to do. It's small size, however, made it easy to lose. Those less organized or with a messy desk may find themselves in a small panic when they are led to believe they lost their Mycestro, only to realize it had been misplaced under a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Mycestro is made from glossy plastic and grippy rubber. Though the plastic is shiny, I never noticed any fingerprints on it. The rubber piece fits your finger, and stays. it's sturdy and doesn't get loose during use. The device definitely does not feel flimsy or cheap when in hand, and feels good on the finger. Overall it feels very natural and comfortable during wear, everything I would expect from a wearable mouse.</p>

<h2>Configuration:</h2>
<p>The configuration of Mycestro is where I believe the device falls short. On Mycestro's website, it lists "Linux" as supported. Sure enough, after charging Mycestro and plugging in the usb dongle, I was able to use it. Unfortunately, the device speed and sensitivity made it difficult to click on anything. After looking online for a configuration application, such that is available on MacOSX and Windows, I came to the conclusion that there is none. So, Mycestro is supported on linux up to the point of configuration.</p>
<p>After a long and tedious configuration of the Mycestro settings through the command line using Open Source xf86-input-synaptics tool,and setting up a custom bash script to apply these settings when I want (because they would reset if I disconnected then reconnected Mycestro) I was able to get Mycestro to work well on Linux. I later discovered that if you plug Mycestro into a Windows or MacOSx computer and configure the device with the control application from there, the settings will travel over to Linux.</p>
<p>Configuring the device on Windows was a breeze compared to Linux. All I had to do was download the configuration software, and from there was able to update the firmware, change the speed, acceleration, and sensitivity in all axes of the device.</p>

<h2>Usability/Performance:</h2>
<p>When I first started using Mycestro, it was a bit confusing. I was under the impression that it worked off pointing. So I tried directing my finger to things on the screen, but the cursor just remained in the corner of my screen. After a bit of frustration, I figured out that it works off of a series of movements, as opposed to continually pressing the device. Instead of pointing, I discovered it's better to have your finger parallel to the screen as opposed to perpendicular with the screen. Mycestro scrolling feature (sliding your thumb up and down on the touchpad area) worked great. It was easy, smooth and fluid. No configuration or sensitivity problems whatsoever and worked wherever I wanted it to.</p>
<p>The Mycestro definitely gets some getting used to when you first get it. After that, however, I found it easy to use. Tt works well for day-to-day use, becoming most useful when I was further away from my computer. During a movie as a remote control, or a presentation, the Mycestro really shines. You can do anything you would be able to do with a real mouse, but on your finger. So I was able to change T.V shows, pause, resume, etc. while in bed or performing some other task, like cooking or just microwaving popcorn, while watching Netflix. During a presentation, I was able to totally control the presentation from my finger, instead of reverting back to the computer to switch slides or perform some task to move on with the presentation. In this sense, I found the Mycestro exceptionally useful.</p>
<p>I found the battery a bit disappointing. The two hour charge barely got me through two days, and it became definite that I had to charge it by the end of the day. One can't expect much more out of a device as small as the Mycestro, however, since a larger battery would make the Mycestro bulky and unweildy.</p>
<p>Mycestro does work with charging, though it is not the ideal way to use it. The charging cable restricts movement and is just bothersome, but when it loses it's battery I had no other choice than to plug it in and use it.</p>
<p>If you are an avid gamer, however, I would not recommend this device. I tried playing a game of Agar.io and Miniclip Pool with the Mycestro, and, needless to say, I lost and performed poorly in every game. The Mycestro is definitely not meant for the hardcore or even casual gamer. If you are a gamer and reading this review, I recommend getting yourself a mouse meant for gaming, rather than dabbling in wearable tech. It's just not there yet. Playing with a Mycestro just does not provide enough accuracy and precision absolutely crucial for gaming.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The Mycestro really is a new and useful device to add to the plethora of todays wearable technology. It's sleek, light, looks great, and can perform everything that a regular mouse can. If you can get past the battery life, and after a bit of tinkering, configuration, and getting used to, you can definitely use this device as a total replacement for your mouse (as long as you're not a gaming fan). It would probably save some desk space, and you have the added benefit of showing your friends your tech enthusiasm. The Mycestro is most useful during presentations or away from your desk, when walking back to your computer and using the mouse is a hassle or not the best option.</p>
<p>Overall, Mycestro is a step in the right direction for wearable mice. It may not be the be-all end-all for mice worn on your fingertips, but it's definitely useful and does everything that a mouse can serving as an adequate replacement for your physical desktop mouse.<br />
