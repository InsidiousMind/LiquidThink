<p>So you've decided you want to reclaim your internet freedom by remaining more anonymous online, great! You've come to the right place.</p>
<p>But for all those that stumbled in this article in their drunken stupor of internet curiosity, let me first explain what a VPN is, and why you should use one.</p>
<a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2014/11/vpn-02.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-804" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/vpn-02-300x172.png" alt="vpn-02" width="300" height="172" /></a>
<p>In short a VPN is a Virtual Private Network (VPN, duh). It's a virtual version of the network I am assuming your already connected to, since your reading this article on the internet. This virtual private network is a group of computers networked together over the internet, the public network. You can use this private network to anonymize yourself, when using untrusted public networks. VPN's are able to encrypt your traffic and keep your IP address private, replacing your IP with the one from the VPN provider. So, you can live in the most populated part of NJ, but to others on the net reading your IP, it will look like you live in the remotest part of Wyoming.</p>
<p>VPN's started out as a tool used by corporations and businesses to encrypt and keep communications private. Recently, however, personal VPN's have been becoming more popular, especially with all the hype around the NSA. VPN's help against malicious hackers wanting to snipe your information from the web. The VPN will protect this information.</p>
<p>The installation of a VPN could not be simpler.</p>
<h3>Step One: Choose a VPN Provider</h3>
<p>There are so many great VPN providers out there. Refer to our "Top 5 VPN providers" if you need help choosing.</p>
<h3>Step Two: Install a VPN Client</h3>
<p>Usually OpenVPN is the VPN client of choice. It's available for all operating systems, and it works best out of all other VPN clients. There really is no reason you shouldn't be using it. If your device is not compatible, however, you can always use the PPTP/L2TP/SOCKS Security alternatives.</p>

<h3>Step Three: Login Credentials</h3>
<p>During the installation of the client, your probably going to come across fields where you enter your login credentials. You should have received an email or some kind of communication from the VPN provider you picked. Usually it asks for login firsts, which it then verifies with your VPN provider, and then asks for password, and verifies again. If both verifications come through positive, PRESTO! You can connect to a VPN through your network. Not too hard, was it?</p>
<p>If your feeling adventurous, you can even go ahead and create your own VPN using Hamachi -- but that's another article for another time. If you want to remain updated on more articles to come, make sure to subscribe to our newsletter!</p>
<p>That's all there is too it! I hope you enjoy your Internet Freedom Awesomeness!</p>
