<p>It is a problem that can get away from you quickly. It happens in homes and is particularly a troublesome issue in offices and businesses. It may start one at a time, but in short order, they can become a twisted mess. It is the problem of cable management.</p>
<p>Cable management means properly managing all of the electrical cords, monitor cables, printer cables, and other associated wires and cords connecting today’s technology. There are some very good reasons to take it seriously. Here are five reasons to better manage your cables.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>One of the most visible reasons to take care of your cables properly is aesthetics. Improperly managed cables look messy and can convey a larger message about how you conduct business. On the other hand, cables that are neatly taken care of also sends a message.</p>
<p>It tells employees and visitors that you pay attention to detail and are concerned about the impression you make. Managed cables convey a sense of professionalism. Loose cables are unsightly and may cause other problems.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p>Loose cables and electrical cords can quickly become a safety issue in a variety of ways. Legs and feet can get tangled. Chair rollers can get caught. This can result in injuries due to tripping or falls. It can also result in equipment being inadvertently pulled off of surfaces, causing other injuries and property damage.</p>
<p>In the case of cables that carry electrical current, improperly managed cables are more likely to short out causing fires. Managed cables are much safer, eliminating some potential hazards and dangers.</p>
<p><strong>Wear and Tear</strong></p>
<p>Exposed cables are subject to wear by coming into contact with foot traffic, furniture legs and chair rollers. Cables can become compressed, cut and otherwise damaged and that will shorten their lifespan and even cause equipment failure.</p>
<p>In some cases, worn out or cut power cables could create a fire. Managed cables will last longer and look better.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Managed cables and wires require less maintenance and when labeled properly, can actually save time during maintenance. Because they are less prone to damage, they will provide service for a longer period of time and require overall less attention. Chasing down wiring problems can be frustrating and managed cables can reduce those cable issues.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Replacement</strong></p>
<p>Properly managed cables can make equipment replacement much easier and less time consuming. When cables are properly labeled, you avoid the problem of trying to trace each wire to see where it is going and replacing a particular piece of gear becomes simpler. It also saves time and installation, as well as replacement costs.</p>
<p>There are some very practical reasons to take wire and cable management seriously. They will look better in the short term and provide better and safer service in the long run. If your cabling is taking away from the professional appearance of work areas you are involved with, consider a cable management system. It can pay for itself in multiple ways and provide additional professionalism.</p>
<p>For server rack cabling solutions, consider cable management bars or a cable tray, to help keep the rats nest away.</p>
