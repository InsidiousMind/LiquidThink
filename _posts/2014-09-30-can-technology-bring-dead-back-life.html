<p><a href="https://www.singularityweblog.com/ray-kurzweil-singularity/">Ray Kurzweil </a>is a well renowned engineer, because of his advancement in the fields of text, speech and audio technology. Kurzweil can brag about being an inventor, entrepreneur, visionary,and working for Google as the Director of Engineering. As the inventor of the first optical character recognition system (OCR),  a software used to transform written words into data used as a reading equipment for the blind, for recreating grand piano music, and to make a commercially marketed software to recognize speech, he is definitely a person important to technology. Moreover, he has written some of New York's best-selling books that include 'How to Create a Mind', 'The Singularity is near', and 'The Age of Spiritual Machines'. Google has allotted around $250,000 for his graduating school, Singularity University, where students' main focus will be biotech, robots and artificial intelligence. After a 10 week course, students will create their own start-up instead of getting a regular degree like other graduating schools.</p>

<p>This article is about one of Kurzweil's dizzying theories about the future of human species and the limits of biology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil plans on developing a way to make humans immortal, and to bring back his dead father who died at an early age in 1970. Kurzweil believes that the sufferings of the world can be overcome by figuring out the right solutions (some crazy sci-fi stuff right there). He believes in creating a virtual version of the dead by feeding data into a computer cable. His theories are rooted back to the idea of technological singularity, which means a time when the line of difference between a human and a machine will totally blur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attempting to create a replica of the human brain in order to understand its brain's problems and figure out cures to mental and neurological illnesses, Kurzweil fantasizes about a search engine that would be able to anticipate what people are thinking even before they themselves know, by accessing a database of the thoughts in your head, that would be stored in a Cloud.</p>

<p>The question is, are Ray Kurzweil's plans moral? Throwing aside the crazy sci-fi vibe this guy gives off, and assuming what he says is possible, is it moral to bring the dead back to life, or to create immortal human beings? Even if we defy the very nature of life, can we still <em>do it?</em> Bringing someone back to life may or may not effect the cycle of life by nature and could have consequences we may not even think plausible (zombie apocalypse anyone?). We all have emotional attachments with people who have passed away, but life and death are natural cycles, and you can do nothing to put it at a halt or slow it down.</p>

<p>Critics have labeled Ray Kurzweil's ideas as ridiculous , but technology has made some unimaginable advancements in the past. Just compare an old cell phone from 5 years ago, with today's Iphone 6. Kurzweil himself has many times over proved critics very wrong.</p>

<p>It is of my opinion that what Kurzweil may do, albeit extremely fascinating, is immoral. A dead person serves no place or purpose in today's society, they belong to the past.. But that's just my opinion. Leave a comment and let me know what <em>you</em> think.</p>
