<p>It's been almost 2 years since Edward Snowden first leaked information containing classified National Security Agency Operations. There was public outcry, who likes their information being stolen and looked through by a government organization? I certainly don't.</p>
<p>What have we done about it to stop the NSA?</p>
<p>Well nothing, really. Public debate right now is severely lacking. When John Oliver compares it to a turtle having sex, you know it's bad. Just look at this video for proof:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GH68bSJXGE8" width="425" height="350"></iframe></p>
<p>A congress woman was interrupted during a talk on Section 215 because of Justin Beiber!? Wow.</p>
<p>All this goes to show is what people want to hear more about. Obviously, the news station was getting more traffic from showing Justin Beibers actions than actual news. It's almost <em>unbeliebable.</em></p>
<p>Somethings obviously wrong here. Section 215 expires June 1st, and the date is fast approaching. If there is anytime for debate, that time is now.</p>
<p>John Oliver did a great segment recently on Government Surveillance.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XEVlyP4_11M" width="425" height="350"></iframe></p>
<p>From it, arose an amazing (and hilarious) website, <a href="https://cantheyseemydick.com/">CanTheySeeMyDick. </a>(alluding to the long Dick Joke John Oliver accomplishes in the video. Props to him.)</p>
<p>Well, can the NSA see your dick? As of now, that is a definite and resounding YES. Section 215 is just one way the NSA uses to accomplish this. There are many more provisions too, like Executive Order 12333 or Section 702.</p>
<p>Section 215 is being reauthorized June 1st, however. So, it makes sense to tackle that first. What is section 215, exactly? Simply, it allows</p>
<p>the NSA to track your calls and, in some countries, see the content of those calls. According to Edward Snowden as well as <em>CanTheySeeMyDick</em>:</p>
<p>"they can probably tell who you're sharing your junk pictures with because they're seeing who you're texting with, who you're calling."</p>
<p>So it allows the NSA to see the phone numbers of who you're texting and calling, and for how long. This may not sound like much, but it gives away so much; especially to a large agency such as the NSA.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2015/04/us-government-nsa-indiscriminate-spying-on-all-americans.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1459" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/us-government-nsa-indiscriminate-spying-on-all-americans.jpg" alt="us-government-nsa-indiscriminate-spying-on-all-americans" width="500" height="374" /></a><br />
Is it a U.S specific problem? Nope. The NSA spies on everything and everybody they can. There were even reports that the NSA was spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In fact, the NSA has more freedom spying on people outside the US then within. It even uses this to it's advantages; if domestic information gets on a foreign server, it can intercept that information from that server. This isn't rare, either. Say you're storing something on Google Drive. Google has many servers all over the world. Your information gets passed around all the time by Google. Due to Googles affiliation with the NSA through PRISM, the NSA is able to take that data off while it's on a stay in another country.Â So can we stop the NSA? The internet has already shown it's power in stopping SOPA, and has had resounding successes with Net Neutrality. Do I think that the internet will be able to help stop the NSA? Yes. Will it be hard? Ohhh yeahhh*.<br />
But we can do it. For starters we should make a petition, and spread more awareness about the subject. As pointed out by John Oliver, not many know who Edward Snowden is or what he did; what they do know is that they don't want their Dick Pic's passed around by government officials. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/national-security-agency-barack-obama-section-215-expires-june-1st-stop-it-s-reauthorization-and-spread-awareness?just_created=true">Here </a>is a petition, spread it around and share it!</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2015/04/index.jpe"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1460" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/index.jpe" alt="index" width="225" height="225" /></a>From there? Well, I can't say I'm exactly the person to organize this all, as it should be the collective decision of the internet. I'm just a cog in a wheel, what I know, however, is that if this wheel starts spinning then great things happen. Will it be enough to stop the reauthorization of section 215? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: The NSA should <em>not</em> be allowedto invade privacy to such an extreme level.</p>
<p>While on the topic of Edward Snowden, and if you didn't already know, there was a bust of Snowden put up illegally in New York City. It's visually appealing and fits the overall style of other statues in the area. Pretty great way of showing support, isn't it?</p>
