<p style="text-align: left;" align="CENTER">Predicting the future is something usually left to prophets, visionaries, or lunatics on the side of a NYC Street. Thankfully, I have, and always will be, a lunatic. The world is moving forward with a significant pace and if you consider the amount of technology that mankind has at its disposal at the moment; anything can be possible in the future. Following are some of the ideas that will portray how exactly technology will look and shape in the coming 100 years; whether they be far-out theory or based more on fact. These ideas may sound ambitious though it is worth remembering that anything is possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Google will take over the world</span></p>
<p>Google is moving forward with great momentum, and their momentum is only increasing. The company does not only aim to dominate the industry but it remains hungry for research and innovation. Since it's founding, Google has moved from being a single search engine to working in more areas, including but not limited to home appliances, mobile devices, and robots. There ambition and expansion have not stopped yet, however, and they only continue to expand. Google is already a large part of our everyday life. Imagine what will occur in the next few years,decades, or even millenia. For example, Google has offered translation services to people for free and in 100 years it is safe to say that Google would be able to improve it's translation algorithms tremendously. I would not be surprised if our smart phones are able to translate speech into Mandarin, and be able to output it through a speaker instantly.<br />

<p>In the future it may be safe to say that passwords will cease to exist. Google is making serious progress in making improvements to the face recognition software, which will only make passwords redundant. Moreover, it is also predicted that Google should be able to digitize more than 100 million books which means that Google will dominate the market of digital books.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D printers</span></p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="http://liquidthink.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/future-3d-printing-technology.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-259" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/future-3d-printing-technology-300x240.jpg" alt="future-3d-printing-technology" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>The use of 3D printers is still at an immature stage where it is only able to print things with certain specific materials. They are, however, already proving their usefulness in the world. 3D printers, for example, have proved very useful for dentists since they are able to make personalized appliances for teeth based on each individual patient through laser scans. As time progresses, the use of the 3D printer will also increase. Since the printer is still in it's infant stages, many more innovations and improvements will come, and eventually, the printer will become commercialized and available for the average consumer. This has many obvious benefits. Car parts that cannot be found on the market, for example, will be downloaded easily through the internet and printed to fit into a car. There are virtually limitless possibilities to what we could utilize a 3-D printer for. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/shorewood-engineer-builds-castle-with-3-d-concrete-printer/273410261/">This guy</a>&nbsp;built a Castle with a 3-D printer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synthetic diet</span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>Research is already being done on synthetic meat and scientists are making meat with the help of plants and vegetables. You can easily find bacon on the market that is actually made with vegetables. This is not simply something that will quell the horrific battles between vegetarians and non-vegetarians but it will also allow everyone to consume a more nutritious diet. While synthetic meat at the moment is not that popular and easy to detect through its taste, it is safe to say that in 100 years every single person in the world will be able to dine in peace on synthetic meat without raising a protest over animal killing. This is, however, highly debated. Many don't consider the possibility that synthetic meat will ever be on the same level as&nbsp;<em>real</em> meat--but if there is not a difference at all, in protein, taste, and calories, why complain?</p>
