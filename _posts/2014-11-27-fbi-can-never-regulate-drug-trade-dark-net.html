<p class="western" lang="en-US">For every “major victory” the government seems to gain in the battle against drug trade in the online world, there seems to be a new member ready to step aside and replace the old syndicate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or the FBI, recently brought down the latest big name in the drug trading syndicated online, known as Silk Road 2.0. The name is, of course, in homage to the original Silk Road website that was so publicized in 2012.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">However, the gap in the market has already been replaced – Evolution has now stepped in as the largest Dark Net supplier of all-time, surpassing all previous Silk Road websites and similar. While the <a href="http://liquidthink.net/feds-havent-actually-busted-400-darknet-sites/">FBI may have taken down 400 Dark Net websites</a></p>
<p> in the last few years, websites like Evolution have spent their time being even bolder with their product offerings.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="http://liquidthink.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/darknet1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-855" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/darknet1-300x225.jpg" alt="darknet1" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">For example, on Evolution you can buy anything from counterfeit documentation to a stolen bank account. The vast majority of this is purchased with the same ease that you would if you were buying something from eBay or Amazon. Just launched in 2014, Evolution has quickly sprung up with the help of the knowledge of its founders, The Carding Forum. Experienced in the anonymous market, they are specialists in ID and financial theft.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">Evolution has, currently, 20,221 products on its listings. This is already a staggering 28.8% increase since last month alone, but the look at the last six months is even more staggering – they have tripled their product volume in that time. It’s growing at an exponential rate, far quicker than you would ever expect to see any typical business develop. Add in the evolution of Agora as well. With around 18,000 products, Agora offers a chance for users to pick up illegal substances with ease. While it’s struggled to deal with the aftermath of the closure of Silk Road 2.0, closing registrations entirely, it’s still one of the premium markets on the list at the moment for those who are already members.</p>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">The hardest thing for the FBI to track on these types of websites, specifically when it comes to the drug trading side of things is actually stopping this at the source. Dark Net has been fuelled by the incredible ability and potential of experts who are sickened by the modern corporate environment. Instead of working in a typical job, they use their skills in the anonymous market to do whatever is needed. Therefore, the animosity towards how things are normally done matched with the expertise of the individuals behind Dark Net websites means that when one is closed, another will open with even more determination.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="http://liquidthink.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hydra.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-856" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hydra-241x300.jpg" alt="hydra" width="241" height="300" /></a></p>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">This is shown in the quality of sales volume alone. When compared to the 20,000 listings that Evolution has, Silk Road 2.0 only hit the 17,000 mark at it’s very peak. Before that, Silk Road got to around 13,000. Therefore, the development curve for these sites is that every time one is taken down, a larger and even more driven equivalent appears. With so much anonymous action going on, it’s almost impossible to stop them all – the Dark Net has almost taken on hydra-like attributes. Shut one down, and another returns, stronger than the last.</p>
