<p>Total and anonymous freedom such as that seen with the Darknet comes with some problems. The most notorious being the Online Black Market. On this notorious market, as many of you already know, one can buy literally anything...<em>anything</em>. I'm talking Ectasy, Cocaine, Marijuana.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you add people to the mix, specifically minors.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2015/04/Tor_project_logo_hq.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1506" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/Tor_project_logo_hq-300x190.png" alt="Tor_project_logo_hq" width="300" height="190" /></a>Downloading, installing, and navigating the TOR browser is easy, maybe <em>too</em> easy. This means pretty much anyone who can install an email client can also get onto the most notrious black market ever created,  including minors. Approximately two years ago, a teen was turned in by his mother for buying drugs on the deepweb. How was he caught? He had the stuff delivered right to his mailbox. It wasn't the Police, FBI, or CIA who caught him. No, not even the NSA. It was his mother, who was so surprised at narcotics arriving in her mail she went straight to the cops. The seller of these drugs is not known, conveniently hidden behind the veil of TOR, VPN's and PGP encryption it would be almost impossible to catch them.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that teen is probably facing felony charges which will put a permanent record stain on him for the rest of his life. His seller, however, gets away scott-free.<a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2015/04/as_skate_Osh_BlackmarketDeals_2048.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1523" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/as_skate_Osh_BlackmarketDeals_2048-300x184.jpg" alt="as_skate_Osh_BlackmarketDeals_2048" width="300" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>The Deepweb is the wild-west of our day. Criminals reign free avoiding jail and doing as they please behind their cyber-masks.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of the DeepWeb being a heaven for Drug Lords and Druggies alike to launder. Allowing for near-perfect anonymity makes it extremely difficult to catch these people on the most vicious Black Market ever created. Sure, the <a title="Feds haven’t actually busted 400+ Darknet Sites" href="http://liquidthink.net/feds-havent-actually-busted-400-darknet-sites/">FBI can try taking notorious sites like the Silkroad down</a>, but there are hundreds which already exist and take it's place. That's not even getting into the new anonymity protocol (I2P) the <em>next</em> rendition of the Silk Road is being moved to after the second rendition of the SilkRoad was taken down from it's Onion site.</p>
<p>How does law enforcement plan to deal with this ongoing issue?<br />
I don't think even they know. As of now they have resorted to scaring users from it by taking down big names such as the Silk Road and it's founders. The enormous amount of other sites, however, make such arrests and takedowns useless.</p>
<p>So basically, the Deepweb is Gondor, except with Hordes of Orcs inside instead of humans. They do as they please, if one falls the one next to it arises, there is no stopping them.</p>
<p><a class="lightbox" href="{{site.url}}uploads/2015/04/Carn_dum.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1526" src="{{site.url}}uploads/oldImg/Carn_dum.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="800" height="574" /></a></p>
<p>While this article focuses mostly on the negatives of the Deepweb, one cannot simply disregard the postitives. Absolute anonymity has great benefits, which are being fleshed out more everyday with each new relevation of NSA surveillance. Anonymity helps whistleblowers and justice-seekers alike. In many places that restrict freedoms, TOR is a godsend allowing it's citizens to bypass censorship and research/write/speakout against corrupt governments.</p>
<p>Like every new invention, their are drawbacks. Nuclear technology annihilated Hiroshima and Nagasaki, yet it advanced science to levels never-before-seen.</p>
