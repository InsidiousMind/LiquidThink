Don’t make the mistake of using [common words](http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm) and phrases because they’re easy to guess. That is especially the case when hackers can use custom programs loaded with word lists. The software will try millions of combinations in a matter of minutes. So, it’s easy for them to find the words you used and gain access. For that reason, you need to ensure your passwords are complex and random. You should also change them frequently for the best outcomes. Try to use a combination of lower and upper case. You could also add numbers to the passwords to make sure they’re as secure as possible. DO NOT STORE A FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS THE PASSWORDS!
