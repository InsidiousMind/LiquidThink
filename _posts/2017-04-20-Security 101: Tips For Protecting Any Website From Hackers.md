Nobody wants their website to get hacked by criminals who want to use it to make dodgy money. That is especially the case if you are running a business site, or depend on your website to be credible. Thankfully, there are lots of things you can do to make a hackers life more difficult. There are so many vulnerable websites out there, if a hacker finds it too difficult to break into one site under a certain amount of time, chances are they will move on to an easier site to crack. With that in mind, some fantastic tips on this page should help you to stay secure. Hopefully, the information is pretty straightforward, and it shouldn’t take you long to put these ideas into practice. Also, you won’t have to break the bank or spend too much cash. You have to keep in mind, however, this is pretty basic stuff. There's many more technical things you can do to harden your site and put it behind an iron-quadruple-locked door. But, this is a good start.

### Keep all software up to date

The first thing you need to do is make sure you always update your software. That is the single best advice we could give to website owners. As time progresses, vulnerabilities, backdoors, zero-days and other liabilities are discovered and spread amongst the internet and various hacker communities. When that happens, they can often [gain access to a site](http://liquidthink.net/the-ultimate-guide-to-keeping-your-information-from-the-nsa-and-other-prying-eyes) or system fast. At some point, the developers will notice something is wrong. They will then solve the issue and release an update. If you fail to download the new version of the software, criminals can still use their techniques to steal information. So, make sure you check for updates every week and download them immediately. If you do that, any vulnerabilities should disappear. Some infrastructures and frameworks, like Wordpress, have an option for automatic security updates. If this option is available, make certain to enable it. Even with this option, however, it's smart to keep all your plugins and installed software in check and up to date.

### Use complex passwords and change them regularly

You will use passwords for your website and all your computer systems. Don’t make the mistake of using [common words](http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm) and phrases because they’re easy to guess. It's not very hard for a hacker to input a "word list" containing thousands upon thousands of common words into a tool which can repeatedly input these passwords until it finds the right one in a matter of seconds. So, it’s easy for them to find the words you used and gain access. For that reason, you need to ensure your passwords are complex and random. For the best outcome, I would recommend to change the main password on your website once a month, or at the very least once every 6 months. Try to use a combination of lower and upper case, special characters, and numbers. I should probably stress the obvious here, but something that happens all too often, *DO NOT STORE A FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS THE PASSWORDS!*. That's certainly a mistake you don't want to make, and once which may come back and bite you in the buttocks.

### Download and install web security tools

Most website owners use WordPress or another site builder these days. They’re fantastic tools because they enable you to create a professional design without coding, or through a streamlined and easy-to-use interface on top of the code. Indeed, that’s why your [IT support company](https://www.netstar.co.uk/it-support/) has probably recommended this move already. For Wordpress, plugins like the "All In One WP Security & Firewall" is a great starting point for anyone looking to better secure their Wordpress site, but may not necessarily be familiar with all the nitty-gritty technical back-end stuff. Depending on your needs, however, you are probably going to want to research a good tool to use in Google. This can be a scary endeavor, however, and I should warn you to be weary of phishing sites which want you to install their "Security Tool" which, in reality, will simply install a back-door and do the opposite promised. That's not a very good outcome, now is it? Make sure to check that the tool you found is mentioned by a *reputable* site. In addition, tools which are Open Source and have a strong community following are much better then one which may not.

Having read those tips, you should now have a good idea about the best places to start with website security. However, there is always more to learn, and so you should take a look at some of the other articles on this blog. Have a fantastic day, and stay safe!
